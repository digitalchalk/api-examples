Examples for using DigitalChalk API v5 in Java.  Be sure to change the values in /src/main/resources/apiconfig.properties to your proper values.

These examples use Maven for build, and Spring 3, Jackson2, and HttpClient 4 in code.

To Build:

```
mvn package
```

Deploy .war file to any application container (like Tomcat).  By default, the application is mapped to /apiexamples
